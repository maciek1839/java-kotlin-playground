# Java release

- [JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/21-relnote-issues.html) | 19th September 2023
  - Pattern matching for switch
  - Sequenced collections
  - Record patterns
    - Enhance the Java programming language with record patterns to deconstruct record values.
  - Virtual threads
- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/17-relnote-issues.html) | 14th September 2021
    - Sealed classes
        - Sealed classes let you restrict or permit class hierarchies to only certain types.
        - This is incredibly useful for pattern matching as you have a specific number of classes to switch between.
    - Pattern matching (instanceof)
    - Records
        - A record can neither extend a class nor it can be extended by another class. It’s a final class.
    - Text blocks
    - Better handling of NullPointerException
      - In Java 17 the exception pinpoints out where and what our null object reference is.
    - Compact Number Formatting Support
- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/11-relnote-issues.html) | 25th September 2018
    - A No-Op Garbage Collector / Epsilon
    - Removed deprecated modules e.g. Java EE and CORBA
- JDK 10
    - Local Variable Type Inference (var)
    - Unmodifiable Collections (List.copyOf)
        - The `Collections.unmodifiableList` method returns an unmodifiable view of the source List.
        - So if the source List is modified, these changes are reflected in the unmodifiable List.
        - The `copyOf` methods on the other hand, return a read-only copy of the source collection.
    - Container Awareness
        - Extract container-specific configuration instead of querying the operating system itself.
- JDK 9
    - Modular System – Jigsaw Project
    - Diamond Operator Extension
        - Use diamond operator in conjunction with anonymous inner classes.
    - Try-With-Resources
    - Interface Private Method
    - Compact strings
        - Before Java 9, Strings were internally represented using UTF-16 encoding, where each character occupied 2 bytes in memory.
        - Starting from Java 9, the Compact Strings feature optimizes memory usage by dynamically adjusting storage based on character content.
        - If a String contains only ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) characters, it is stored using 1 byte per character instead of 2.
        - If a String contains non-ASCII (Unicode) characters, it retains the UTF-16 representation.
        - This optimization reduces memory consumption and improves performance for ASCII-based strings without affecting functionality.
- [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8-whats-new.html)
    - Lambda expressions
    - Method references
    - Functional interfaces
    - Stream API
    - Default methods
    - Static methods in interface
    - Optional class
