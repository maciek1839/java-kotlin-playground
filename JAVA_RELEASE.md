# Java release

- JDK 21
    - String templates
    - Record patterns
    - Pattern matching for switch
      - 
    - Virtual threads
      - .
    - Sequenced collections
- JDK 17
    - Sealed classes
        - Sealed classes let you restrict or permit class hierarchies to only certain types.
        - This is incredibly useful for pattern matching as you have a specific number of classes to switch between.
    - Pattern matching (instanceof)
    - Records
        - A record can neither extend a class nor it can be extended by another class. It’s a final class.
        - Declared fields are private and final.
    - Text blocks
    - Better handling of NullPointerException
      - In Java 17 the exception pinpoints out where and what our null object reference is.
    - Compact Number Formatting Support
- JDK 11
    - A No-Op Garbage Collector / Epsilon
    - Removed deprecated modules e.g. Java EE and CORBA
- JDK 10
    - Local Variable Type Inference (var)
    - Unmodifiable Collections (List.copyOf)
        - The `Collections.unmodifiableList` method returns an unmodifiable view of the source List.
        - So if the source List is modified, these changes are reflected in the unmodifiable List.
        - The `copyOf` methods on the other hand, return a read-only copy of the source collection.
    - Container Awareness
        - Extract container-specific configuration instead of querying the operating system itself.
- JDK  9
    - Modular System – Jigsaw Project
    - Diamond Operator Extension
        - Use diamond operator in conjunction with anonymous inner classes.
    - Try-With-Resources
    - Interface Private Method
    - Compact strings
        - A Java String (before Java 9) is represented internally in the Java VM using bytes, encoded as UTF-16.
        - UTF-16 uses 2 bytes to represent a single character.
        - From Java 9 and forward, The Java VM can optimize strings using a new Java feature called compact strings.
        - The compact strings feature lets the Java VM detect if a string only contains ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 characters.
        - If it does, the String will only use 1 byte per character internally.
- JDK  8
    - Lambda expressions
    - Method references
    - Functional interfaces
    - Stream API
    - Default methods
    - Static methods in interface
    - Optional class
