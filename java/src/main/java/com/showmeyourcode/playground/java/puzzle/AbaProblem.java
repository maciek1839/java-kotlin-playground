/**
 * In multithreaded computing, the ABA problem occurs during synchronization,
 * when a location is read twice, has the same value for both reads,
 * and "value is the same" is used to indicate "nothing has changed".
 * However, another thread can execute between the two reads and change the value,
 * do other work, then change the value back,
 * thus fooling the first thread into thinking "nothing has changed" even though the second thread did work that violates that assumption.
 *
 * References: <https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_ABA>
 *
 * How ABA Happens
 * Thread 1 reads a value A.
 * Thread 2 changes the value from A â†’ B and then back to A.
 * Thread 1 sees that the value is still A and proceeds, unaware that an intermediate change occurred.
 *
 * Where ABA Occurs
 * Lock-free data structures (e.g., stacks, queues).
 * Memory management (e.g., garbage collection, reference counting).
 * Optimistic concurrency control (e.g., databases, transactional memory).
