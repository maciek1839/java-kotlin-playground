                A mutex (or mutual exclusion) is the simplest type of synchronizer â€“
                it ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section of a computer program at a time.
                
                Mutex is a specific kind of binary semaphore that is used to provide a locking mechanism.
                It stands for Mutual Exclusion Object.
                
                To access a critical section, a thread acquires the mutex, then accesses the critical section,
                and finally releases the mutex. In the meantime, all other threads block till the mutex releases.
                As soon as a thread exits the critical section, another thread can enter the critical section.
                The threads hit the lock in random order and may as well leave it the same way.
                The important thing from the JVM's viewpoint is to keep the cores busy working on your program's code.
                
                A synchronized block makes no guarantees about fairness - any of the waiting threads may
                in theory be chosen to execute. If you really want a fair lock (fifo),
                switch to use the newer locking mechanisms introduced in java 5+.
                See for example the documentation for ReentrantLock.
                However, that this results in overall degraded performance and so is not recommended.
                The constructor for this class accepts an optional fairness parameter.
                When set true, under contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting thread.
                Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular access order.
                
                Fairness basically resembles to the likelihood that different threads are able to advance whatever they are doing.
                100% fairness means:
                - all threads should be advancing their work in almost equal portions;
                - 0% fairness means that one single thread might be advancing all the time,
                    and all other threads never (or almost never) make any progress.

                    According to the no preemption condition, resources cannot be taken forcibly from a process
                    a process can only release resources voluntarily after completing its task.
                - Circular Wait

               Causes Of Starvation:
               - High Priority Running Thread
                - Higher-priority threads continuously utilizing resources can lead to starvation for lower-priority threads.
               - Synchronized Block
                - Javaâ€™s synchronized code block provides no guarantee on the entry sequence for waiting threads.
                  This lack of order may result in a thread being blocked indefinitely, waiting to enter the block.
               - Unfair Scheduling Policies
                - Some operating systems or Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementations
                  may employ unfair scheduling policies, favoring certain threads over others.
               - Threads Waiting on an Object
                - The wait() method, when used on an object, may lead to indefinite waiting,
                  as the notify() method does not guarantee awakening a specific waiting thread.
              
               Prevent starvation:
               - Avoid long-running or blocking tasks
               - Use Fair Locks
                   - Employ fair locks, such as Javaâ€™s ReentrantLock with the fairness parameter set to true,
                      to ensure that the longest waiting thread gains access to resources, preventing starvation.
               - Adjust Thread Priorities Carefully
                   - Be cautious when setting thread priorities,
                    as overreliance can lead to priority inversion and, consequently, starvation.
               - Use Timeout Mechanisms
                   - Implement timeout mechanisms when acquiring resources,
                      allowing threads to take alternative actions
