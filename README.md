## Kotlin

> Kotlin is a multiplatform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language. Kotlin took inspiration from many programming languages, including (but not limited to) Java, Scala, C# and Groovy. One of the main ideas behind Kotlin is being pragmatic, i.e., being a programming language useful for day-to-day development, which helps the users get the job done via its features and its tools.
